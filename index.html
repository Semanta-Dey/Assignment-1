            <p>Dr Yunus emphasised the interim government's dedication to restoring democracy, combating corruption, and overhauling key sectors such as the judiciary, banking, and education. He called on all political parties to support these efforts, urging a consensus-driven approach to rebuild the nation on a foundation that truly serves the public interest. His vision for a new Bangladesh is one where the sacrifices made during the recent uprising translate into a just and democratic society.</p>
